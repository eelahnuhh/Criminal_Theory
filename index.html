            <h2>THEORY</h2>
            <h3>What is Social Structure Theory?</h3>
            <p>
              Social Structure Theory is “the view that disadvantaged economic
              class position is a primary cause of crime” (Siegel, 2019, p.
              175). Rather than psychological or biological problems an
              individual may have, social structure theory suggests that a
              person's place in society influences their chances of becoming a
              criminal. For crime to show a steady decrease, this theory urges
              that the societal structure be addressed and managed. Poor people
              are some of the most likely to commit crimes because of a system
              that keeps them at the bottom. They believe they are unable to
              achieve social success and boost their social status, so they
              commit crimes to move themselves and/or their families into a
              better standard of living.

                <h4>Social Strain Theory</h4>
                <p>
                  Social strain theory is one branch of social structure that
                  says that crime is a direct result of frustration and anger
                  from individuals in a low socioeconomic class. People want to
                  grow monetarily and become wealthier, but oftentimes there are
                  not enough resources to allow this to occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Strain Theory argues that crime occurs when there aren't
                  enough legitimate opportunities for people to achieve the
                  normal success goals of a society. In such a situation there
                  is a 'strain' between the goals and the means to achieve those
                  goals, and some people turn to crime in order to achieve
                  success" (Thompson, 2023).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Failure to achieve positively valued goals and a disjunction
                  of expectations and achievements leaves people helpless and
                  confused on why they cannot break from the hardships they are
                  in. Each type of strain increases the chance that negative
                  emotions will occur within an individual and causes crime to
                  be a more likely factor in order to break out of this
                  unfortunate cycle.

                <h4>Social Disorganization Theory</h4>
                <p>
                  Social disorganization theory is another branch of social
                  structure theory that says that people must be aligned with
                  each other in order to keep things orderly in a community.
                  Areas with high population turnover rates, diverse populations
                  with many different ideas on how the community should be run,
                  and poverty are more likely to experience high levels of crime
                  due to a greater chance of weakened social bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Social disorganization is defined as an inability of
                  community members to achieve shared values or to solve jointly
                  experienced problems" (Community Correlates, 2003).
                  Communities thrive when the citizens are able to share their
                  values with each other and build one another up. Conflicting
                  viewpoints and different ideas about life, religion, schools,
                  etc cause a divide within a community which leads to a weak
                  area that is more susceptible to uproars and breakouts of
                  criminal behavior. An area that people do not enjoy living in,
                  that has limited opportunities for growth, can easily turn
                  into something worse when the people of the community do not
                  care to keep it thriving.

                <p>
                  Combines effects of social disorganization and strain to
                  explain how people who are living in lower class neighborhoods
                  react to social isolation and economic issues. The distance
                  from people in your community and a lack of resources leads to
                  strain from most people wanting to get better and do better
                  within their community, but they just cannot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trapped in a low socioeconomic area where lower-class cultural
                  norms have become so popular causes the likelihood of young
                  people in the community to move towards violent or illegal
                  behavior. The more popular crime becomes within an area, the
                  more likely it will be that more and more people will turn to
                  a life of violence and crime because it is all that they see
                  and know.

            <h2>CRIME</h2>
            <h3>Personal Thoughts On Crime</h3>
            <p>
              Crime is an issue that plagues the lives of many all around the
              world. Many different factors contribute to why someone can and
              will commit a crime. Before taking this class, I believed the
              causes of crime were from someone just wanting to commit a crime
              just for the sake of it, greed, or the inability to provide for
              yourself and others around you.
            </p>
            <p>
              After taking this course I now realize how much more goes into
              someone becoming a criminal. The areas you grow up in, the people
              around you, and opportunity all play a role in what you will
              become in the future. Social interaction directly affects how
              likely someone is to start or want to start committing crimes
              simply because of familiarity and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is imperative that people work together to create a strong
              community where everyone can thrive. Crime is not something that
              should only fall onto the individual though. The way society is
              shaped is made for certain people to stay at the bottom, and for
              others to rise up and live comfortable lives. Looking towards the
              government when issues come about, and working hard as a
              community, can be a good way to start meaningful change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Labeling Theory is another part of social structure theory that
              explains why crime may continue even after punishment, or before
              someone has even committed a crime. Labeling theory may target
              people who have not broken the law, but because they look a
              certain way or live in a certain area they may be approached as if
              they had committed a crime more often (Barkan, 2016). This causes
              someone to believe that they must be destined to be a criminal
              because of how often they are being looked at as one.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <img
              src="/images/city-crime.webp"
              alt="City"
              class="img-responsive"
              title="City"
            />
            <p>
              On the other hand, an ex-convict has to live the rest of their
              lives (typically) holding on to the crime they committed even
              after serving time. This is shown in cases where you must check a
              box on a job application on whether you have served time before.
              Having to mention or explain past instances where someone broke
              the law can cause the individual to have a negative self-image and
              possibly succumb to the temptation of committing another crime in
              order to be around people who are more closely related to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Removing the pressure of past actions once someone has served
              their time, in my opinion, should be standard. Individuals should
              be able to come back into society and have opportunities to get
              good jobs and live a normal life. Too often people will come out
              of prison understanding the mistakes they made in the past and
              ready to come back to their families and lives. However, the
              constant reminder of mistakes from the past and labeling when
              trying to get better opportunities leads someone to feel defeated
              and often turn back to crime.

              and different types of crime has been really interesting, and I
