            <h3>What is Social Structure Theory?</h3>
            <p>
              Social structure theory suggests that a person's place in the
              socieconomic structure influences their chances of becoming a
              criminal. Poor people, for example, are more likely to commit
              crimes because they are unable to achieve social success and boost
              their social status in any other way. Social Structure Theory is
              “the view that disadvantaged economic class position is a primary
              cause of crime.” (Siegel, 2019, p. 175)

                <h4>Social Strain Theory</h4>
                <p>
                  Social strain theory is one branch of social structure that
                  says that crime is a direct result of frustration and anger
                  from individuals in a low socioeconomic class. People want to
                  grow monetarily and become more wealthy, but oftentimes there
                  are not enough resources to allow this to occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Strain Theory argues that crime occurs when there aren't
                  enough legitimate opportunities for people to achieve the
                  normal success goals of a society. In such a situation there
                  is a 'strain' between the goals and the means to achieve those
                  goals, and some people turn to crime in order to achieve
                  success" (Thompson, 2023).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Failure to achieve positively valued goals and a disjunction
                  of expectations and achievements leaves people helpless and
                  confused on why they cannot break from the hardships they are
                  in. Each type of strain increases the chance that negative
                  emotions will occur within an individual and causes crime to
                  be a more likely factor in order to break out of this
                  unfortunate cycle.

                <h4>Social Disorganization Theory</h4>
                <p>
                  Social disorganization theory is another branch of social
                  structure theory that says that people must be aligned with
                  each other in order to keep things orderly in a community.
                  Areas with high population turnover rates, diverse populations
                  with many different ideas on how the community should be run,
                  and poverty are more likely to experience high levels of crime
                  due to a greater chance of weakened social bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Social disorganization is defined as an inability of
                  community members to achieve shared values or to solve jointly
                  experienced problems" (Community Correlates, 2003).
                  Communities thrive when the citizens are able to share their
                  values with each other and build one another up. Conflicting
                  viewpoints and different ideas about life, religion, schools,
                  etc cause a divide within a community which leads to a weak
                  area that is more susceptible to uproars and breakouts of
                  criminal behavior. An area that people do not enjoy living in,
                  that has limited opportunities for growth, can easily turn
                  into something worse when the people of the community do not
                  care to keep it thriving.

                <h4>Cultural Deviance Theory</h4>
                <p>
                  Combines effects of social disorganization and strain to
                  explain how people who are living in lower class neighborhoods
                  react to social isolation and economic issues. The distance
                  from people in your community and a lack of resources leads to
                  strain from most people wanting to get better and do better
                  within their community, but they just cannot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trapped in a low socioeconomic area where lower-class cultural
                  norms have become so popular causes the likelihood of young
                  people in the community to move towards violent or illegal
                  behavior. The more popular crime becomes within an area, the
                  more likely it will be that more and more people will turn to
                  a life of violence and crime because it is all that they see
                  and know.

            <h2>CRIME</h2>
            <h3>Features of Crime</h3>
            <p>
              Crime is an issue that plagues the lives of many all around the
              world. Many different factors contribute to why someone can and
              will commit a crime. Before taking this class, I believed the
              causes of crime were from someone just wanting to commit a crime
              just for the sake of it, greed, or the inability to provide for
              yourself and others around you.
            </p>
            <p>
              After taking this course I now realize how much more goes into
              someone becoming a criminal. The areas you grow up in, the people
              around you, and opportunity all play a role in what you will
              become in the future.

              Hi, my name is Ilana Smalls. Learning about criminological theory
              and different types of crime has been really interesting, and I
              hope that it can be showcased well through this website and
              documentary of what I have learned! 💛

              perspective of social structure theory. This website was coded by
