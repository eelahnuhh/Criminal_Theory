            <h3>What is Social Structure Theory?</h3>
            <p>
              Social structure theory suggests that a person's place in the
              socieconomic structure influences their chances of becoming a
              criminal. Poor people, for example, are more likely to commit
              crimes because they are unable to achieve social success and boost
              their social status in any other way. Social Structure Theory is
              ‚Äúthe view that disadvantaged economic class position is a primary
              cause of crime.‚Äù (Siegel, 2019, p. 175)

                <h4>Social Strain</h4>
                <p>
                  Crime is a direct result of frustration and anger from low
                  socioeconomic classes
                </p>
                <p>
                  Failure to achieve positively valued goals, disjunction of
                  expectations and achievements
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each type of strain increases the chance that negative
                  emotions will occur within an individual
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Strain Theory argues that crime occurs when there aren't
                  enough legitimate opportunities for people to achieve the
                  normal success goals of a society. In such a situation there
                  is a 'strain' between the goals and the means to achieve those
                  goals, and some people turn to crime in order to achieve
                  success. (Thompson, 2023)"

                <h4>Social Disorganization Theory</h4>
                <p>
                  Communities with high population turnover rates, diverse
                  populations, and poverty are more likely to experience high
                  levels of crime due to weakened social bonds.

                  "Social disorganization is defined as an inability of
                  community members to achieve shared values or to solve jointly
                  experienced problems"

                  Combines effects of social disorganization and strain to
                  explain how people who are living in lower class neighborhoods
                  react to social isolation and economic issues
                </p>
                <p>
                  Walter Miller: staying within lower-class cultural norms
                  increases the likelihood of joining in violent behavior or
                  illegal behavior. Ex.: Being street smart may lead to drug
                  deals.

            <h2>CRIME</h2>
            <h3>Features of Crime</h3>
            <p>
              Crime is an issue that plagues the lives of many all around the
              world. Many different factors contribute to why someone can and
              will commit a crime. Before taking this class, I believed the
              causes of crime were from someone just wanting to commit a crime
              just for the sake of it, greed, or the inability to provide for
              yourself and others around you.
            </p>
            <p>
              After taking this course I now realize how much more goes into
              someone becoming a criminal. The areas you grow up in, the people
              around you, and opportunity all play a role in what you will
              become in the future.

            <p>
              Hi, my name is Ilana Smalls. Learning about criminological theory
              and different types of crime has been really interesting, and I
              hope that it can be showcased well through this website and
              documentary of what I have learned! üíõ

              perspective of social structure theory. This website was coded by
